/* 
 * Changes made by Tektronix are marked by TEK_HACK, TEK_PROG_HACK, 
 * and GHSFORTRAN.
 * Changes made by Data General are marked by DG_HACK.  Compiling without these
 * #defines should be equivalent to compiling vanilla 3.2, more or less.
 *
 * The changes done by Tektronix fit into three catagories:
 *	TEK_HACK -- these were done just to get GDB to work in our environment,
 *		    including work done to support the Green Hills C compiler.
 *	TEK_PROG_HACK -- These were done to extend GDB by adding programming
 *			 support: things like if-elif-else-endif, while, and
 *			 arguments to user defined commands.
 *	GHSFORTRAN -- These changes make (will make) GDB work with the Green
 *		      Hills Fortran compiler.
 *
 *
 * In addition, I/O routines were renamed so that I/O could be directed
 * to/from the X interface if used.  See the files ui.c and ui.h for
 * more information.  Here are the routines renamed:
 *    Old name:			Renamed to:
 *	fprintf			ui_fprintf
 *	printf			ui_fprintf(stdout
 *	putchar			ui_putchar
 *	putc			ui_putc
 *	fputc			ui_putc
 *	fputs			ui_fputs
 *	puts			ui_puts
 *	gets			ui_gets
 *	fgets			ui_fgets
 *	fflush			ui_fflush
 *	system			ui_system
 *	wait			ui_wait
 *	error			ui_badnews(-1
 *	fatal			ui_badnews(1
 *	getc, fgetc		replaced with ui_gets, ui_fgets
 * These changes are not demarcated by ifdef.   
 *
