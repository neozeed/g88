 *	U of M Modified: 20 Jun 1983 ACT: strange hacks for Emacs
 *
 *	Nov 1983, Mike@@BRL, Added support for 4.1C/4.2 BSD.
 *
 * This is a very fast storage allocator.  It allocates blocks of a small 
 * number of different sizes, and keeps free lists of each size.  Blocks
 * that don't exactly fit are passed up to the next larger size.  In this 
 * implementation, the available sizes are (2^n)-4 (or -16) bytes long.
 * This is designed for use in a program that uses vast quantities of
 * memory, but bombs when it runs out.  To make it a little better, it
 * warns the user when he starts to get near the end.
 *
 * June 84, ACT: modified rcheck code to check the range given to malloc,
 * rather than the range determined by the 2-power used.
 *
 * Jan 85, RMS: calls malloc_warning to issue warning on nearly full.
 * No longer Emacs-specific; can serve as all-purpose malloc for GNU.
 * You should call malloc_init to reinitialize after loading dumped Emacs.
 * Call malloc_stats to get info on memory stats if MSTATS turned on.
 * realloc knows how to return same block given, just changing its size,
 * if the power of 2 is correct.
 */

 * nextf[i] is the pointer to the next free block of size 2^(i+3).  The

 * allocation contiguous by allocating a big chunk, and do SBRKs from
 * there. Once Emacs has dumped there is no reason to continue
 * contiguous allocation, malloc doesn't depend on it.
 *
 * There is a further problem of using brk and sbrk while using VMS C
 * run time library routines malloc, calloc, etc. The documentation
 * says that this is a no-no, although I'm not sure why this would be
 * a problem. In any case, we remove the necessity to call brk and
 * sbrk, by calling calloc (to assure zero filled data) rather than
 * sbrk.
 *
 * VMS_ALLOCATION_SIZE is the size of the allocation array. This
 * should be larger than the malloc size before dumping. Making this
 * too large will result in the startup procedure slowing down since
 * it will require more space and time to map it in.
 *
 * The value for VMS_ALLOCATION_SIZE in the following define was determined
 * by running emacs linked (and a large allocation) with the debugger and
 * looking to see how much storage was used. The allocation was 201 pages,
 * so I rounded it up to a power of two.

/* 
 * Changes made by Tektronix are marked by TEK_HACK, TEK_PROG_HACK, 
 * and GHSFORTRAN.
 * Changes made by Data General are marked by DG_HACK.  Compiling without these
 * #defines should be equivalent to compiling vanilla 3.2, more or less.
 *
 * The changes done by Tektronix fit into three catagories:
 *	TEK_HACK -- these were done just to get GDB to work in our environment,
 *		    including work done to support the Green Hills C compiler.
 *	TEK_PROG_HACK -- These were done to extend GDB by adding programming
 *			 support: things like if-elif-else-endif, while, and
 *			 arguments to user defined commands.
 *	GHSFORTRAN -- These changes make (will make) GDB work with the Green
 *		      Hills Fortran compiler.
 *
 *
 * In addition, I/O routines were renamed so that I/O could be directed
 * to/from the X interface if used.  See the files ui.c and ui.h for
 * more information.  Here are the routines renamed:
 *    Old name:			Renamed to:
 *	fprintf			ui_fprintf
 *	printf			ui_fprintf(stdout
 *	putchar			ui_putchar
 *	putc			ui_putc
 *	fputc			ui_putc
 *	fputs			ui_fputs
 *	puts			ui_puts
 *	gets			ui_gets
 *	fgets			ui_fgets
 *	fflush			ui_fflush
 *	system			ui_system
 *	wait			ui_wait
 *	error			ui_badnews(-1
 *	fatal			ui_badnews(1
 *	getc, fgetc		replaced with ui_gets, ui_fgets
 * These changes are not demarcated by ifdef.

  1. You may copy and distribute verbatim copies of this source file
as you receive it, in any medium, provided that you conspicuously and
appropriately publish on each copy a valid copyright notice "Copyright
(C) 1985 Free Software Foundation, Inc."; and include following the
copyright notice a verbatim copy of the above disclaimer of warranty
and of this License.  You may charge a distribution fee for the
physical act of transferring a copy.
a26 3
  2. You may modify your copy or copies of this source file or
any portion of it, and copy and distribute such modifications under
the terms of Paragraph 1 above, provided that you also do the following:
a27 2
    a) cause the modified files to carry prominent notices stating
    that you changed the files and the date of any change; and
a28 6
    b) cause the whole of any work that you distribute or publish,
    that in whole or in part contains or is a derivative of this
    program or any part thereof, to be licensed at no charge to all
    third parties on terms identical to those contained in this

    warranty protection to some or all third parties, at your option).
a29 52
    c) You may charge a distribution fee for the physical act of
    transferring a copy, and you may at your option offer warranty
    protection in exchange for a fee.

Mere aggregation of another unrelated program with this program (or its
derivative) on a volume of a storage or distribution medium does not bring
the other program under the scope of these terms.

  3. You may copy and distribute this program (or a portion or derivative
of it, under Paragraph 2) in object code or executable form under the terms
of Paragraphs 1 and 2 above provided that you also do one of the following:

    a) accompany it with the complete corresponding machine-readable
    source code, which must be distributed under the terms of
    Paragraphs 1 and 2 above; or,

    b) accompany it with a written offer, valid for at least three
    years, to give any third party free (except for a nominal
    shipping charge) a complete machine-readable copy of the
    corresponding source code, to be distributed under the terms of
    Paragraphs 1 and 2 above; or,

    c) accompany it with the information you received as to where the
    corresponding source code may be obtained.  (This alternative is
    allowed only for noncommercial distribution and only if you
    received the program in object code or executable form alone.)

For an executable file, complete source code means all the source code for
all modules it contains; but, as a special exception, it need not include
source code for modules which are standard libraries that accompany the
operating system on which the executable file runs.

  4. You may not copy, sublicense, distribute or transfer this program
except as expressly provided under this License Agreement.  Any attempt
otherwise to copy, sublicense, distribute or transfer this program is void and
your rights to use the program under this License agreement shall be

their licenses terminated so long as such parties remain in full compliance.

  5. If you wish to incorporate parts of this program into other free
programs whose distribution conditions are different, write to the Free
Software Foundation at 675 Mass Ave, Cambridge, MA 02139.  We have not yet
worked out a simple rule that can be stated here, but we will often permit
this.  We will be guided by the two goals of preserving the free status of
