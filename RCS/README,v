This is GDB with an 88000 simulator and cross-debugging support.
It is called g88 and is hosted on a SUN/4.  G88 is currently in
active use by Horizon Research.  They have Mach running under the
simulator and on a real machine with g88 acting as a cross-debugger.

The first thing for a new cross-debugger or simulator user to do 
is "nroff -man crossgdb.8|more".

If your target is not a Motorola MVME188, you have some coding to
do.  Look at r*.[ch], motomode.c, and the target debug monitor in
directory hmon.

The subdirectory sim has the simulator.  If you don't want the
simulator, delete this directory.

G88 has had almost all of its testing with COFF executables being
fed to it.  So coffread.c has had a lot of testing.  It is currently set
up to read a.out files (i.e., dbx style debugging info) because I
figured that this is what most people outside of Horizon would want.
To switch back to COFF, put the option -DUSEDGCOFF on the command line
(search for this string in the Makefile).

The subdirectory hmon has the target debug monitor for the Motorola 188
board.  It is built with the 88k GNU tools (~ftp/pub/tools88.tar.Z from
cs.washington.edu).  I type this kludgey alias before compiling:

alias m88k "setenv GCC_EXEC_PREFIX ~/m88k/lib/m88k-; \
            set path=(~/m88k/bin ~/m88k/lib  ....

And I put the 88k tools in ~/m88k/{bin,lib}.

The subdirectory gentab has the tools to build a new compress.h from
a target a.out file.

If you compile your C code (that which you wish to debug with g88) with
gcc, put this in your .gdbinit file:

set $gcc_compiled = 1

	Robert Bedichek  1/13/91  robertb@@cs.washington.edu.



And now back to our regularly scheduled file,

This is GDB, a source-level debugger intended for GNU,
presently running under un*x.

Before compiling GDB, you must set up links to five files according to
the kind of machine you are running on.  To do this, type `config.gdb
machine', where machine is something like `vax' or `sun2'.  This
creates links named `param.h', `opcode.h', `pinsn.c', and `infdep.c'.

You might also want to see the comments at the top of the Makefile
about flags needed for various different machine types.

Once these files are set up, just `make' will do everything,
producing an executable `gdb' in this directory.

If you want a new (current to this release) version of the manual, you
will have to use the gdb.texinfo file provided with this distribution.
You may also need to edit the @@setfilename command within the texinfo
file (since it is set as if gdb was in it's normal location within the
emacs source tree).

About the machine-dependent files...

m-<machine>.h

This file contains macro definitions that express information
about the machine's registers, stack frame format and instructions.

<machine>-opcode.h, <machine>-pinsn.c
These files contain the information necessary to print instructions
for your cpu type.

<machine>-dep.c
Those routines which provide a low level interface to ptrace and which
tend to be machine-dependent.  (The machine-independent routines are in
`infrun.c' and `inflow.c')

About debugging gdb with itself...

You probably want to do a "make TAGS" after you configure your
distribution; this will put the machine dependent routines for your
local machine where they will be accessed first by a M-period .

Also, you want to make sure that gdb is not compiled with shared
libraries on the Sun 4.  And you want to make sure that you've
compiled gdb with your local cc or taken appropriate precautions
regarding ansification of include files.  See the Makefile for more
information. 

The "info" command, when executed without a subcommand in a gdb being
debugged by gdb, will pop you back up to the top level gdb.  See
.gdbinit for more details.

About languages other than C...

C++ support has been integrated into gdb; it works, but somewhat
buggily.  Pascal support has not yet been integrated in gdb; the work
is being done.

About -gg format...

Currently GDB version 3.x does *not* support GCC's -gg format.  This
is because it is (in theory) has fast enough startup on dbx debugging
format object files that -gg format is unnecessary (and hence
undesirable, since it wastes space and processing power in gcc).  I
would like to hear people's opinions on the amount of time currently
spent in startup; is it fast enough?

About the remote protocol...

The two files remote-multi.shar and remote-sa.m68k.shar contain two
examples of a remote stub to be used with remote.c.  The the -multi
file is a general stub that can probably be running on various
different flavors of unix to allow debugging over a serial line from
one machine to another.  The remote-sa.m68k.shar is designed to run
standalone on a 68k type cpu and communicate properley with the
remote.c stub over a serial line.  While these two files are provided
without any support (ie. they are passed on directly from the people
who wrote them) comments and suggestions (both implemented and
otherwise) on these files would be appreciated.  Just don't count on
us doing anything about them; mainstream GDB has a higher priority at
the moment.

About reporting bugs...

The correct address for reporting bugs found with gdb is
"bug-gdb@@prep.ai.mit.edu".  Please send all bugs to that address.

About xgdb...

xgdb.c was provided to us by the user community; it is not an integral
part of the gdb distribution.  The problem of providing visual
debugging support on top of gdb is peripheral to the GNU project and
(at least right now) we can't afford to put time into it.  So while we
will be happy to incorporate user fixes to xgdb.c, we do not guarantee
that it will work and we will not fix bugs reported in it.

For those interested in auto display of source and the availability of
an editor while debugging I suggest trying gdb-mode in gnu-emacs.
Comments on this mode are welcome.

The simulator is somewhat tested in this new environment, heavily
tested in the old (Tektronix 68k and 88k workstations).

The cross debugging support has not been tested in this new environment
yet, but like the simulator the bulk of the code has been heavily
tested before on Tektronix machines.  The first thing for a new
cross-debugger or simulator user to do is "nroff -man
crossgdb.8|more".

This is GDB with an 88000 simulator.  It currently reads COFF files.
To read a.out files with dbx stabs:
d5 1
a5 1
1. change the #define in m-m88k.h from COFF_FORMAT to READ_DBX_FORMAT
d7 2
a8 1
2. Remove the option "-DUSEDBHDR" from the Makefile.
d10 5
a14 1
3. do a "make clean"
d16 2
a17 3
4. do a make, check the log file to make sure there are no errors
   (just warnings, like 3 on ui.c, lots of redefined symbols on
    remote.c and motomode.c)
d19 3

The ability to read a.out files is barely tested, expect bugs.
