Subject: New d78, several new commands.


The bug is fixed that Brent ran into on Friday that caused d78 to die
with a bus error when reading a byte from an IO device.

The step, next, stepi, and nexti commands now take an optional
integer argument.  It is the number of lines or instructions to
single step.

A <RET> on a blank line repeats the last command.

The bug where "assign *(addr\&char)=char" wrote adjacent bytes
is fixed.

Numbers inside of character constants are interpreted as
hex instead of octal.  So '\41' == 'A'.

I suggest that everyone doing low-level debugging add the
dbx macros (i.e. aliases) rb, rh, rw, wb, wh, ww to their
$HOME/.d78init files.  These can be found in 
//cupcake/usr/robertb/.d78init.  They read and write bytes,
halfs, and words without affecting surrounding data.

The b format character now means "print a byte in hex" instead
of "print a byte in octal".

Now whenever instructions are disassembled, both the hex address
and the symbolic address are displayed on the left.  The symbolic
address is in the form "routine_name+offset".  Also, the instruction
is displayed in hex and in disassembled form.

The cross-debugging support is closer to being complete.

There is a new d78 man page on cupcake.
