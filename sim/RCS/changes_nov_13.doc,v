Subject: New command in d78 displays IO transactions.
-------

The IO section of the simulator now keeps track of the last 10000
IO operations.  The command "io" in d78 displays part or all of the
trace buffer.  

  "io"                 displays the whole buffer

  "io <address>"       displays all the transactions with the IO device
                       at <address>

  "io <index>"         displays all the transactions with the IO device
                       whose device index is <index>

  "io <address> <count>" 

and 

  "io <index> <count>" are like the previous two forms, except that only 
                       the last <count> transactions are shown.

The fields displayed are the ip of the instruction causing the
IO operation, the data loaded or stored, the size (byte, half, ..),
the operation (load, store, xmem, etc.), the name of the device,
and the physical address of the IO location touched by the operation.
If and xmem is done to cause the IO, the displayed data is that
which was loaded from the device.  The data sent to the device
in an xmem IO operation is not recorded.

Note that "io <address>" will only display transactions that have
<address> as their address, whereas "io <index>" will display all
transactions for the device specified by <index>.  An example
of "io 0":

ip=0x000012e8  data=0x00010001  store word into data_cmmu_0 at 0xfff00200
ip=0x000012e8  data=0x00080079  store word into data_cmmu_0 at 0xfff00404
ip=0x000012e8  data=0x00000039  store word into data_cmmu_0 at 0xfff00400
ip=0x000012e8  data=0x00000000  store word into data_cmmu_0 at 0xfff00008
ip=0x000012e8  data=0x00000000  store word into data_cmmu_0 at 0xfff0000c

and of "io 0fff00400":

ip=0x000012e8  data=0x00000039  store word into data_cmmu_0 at 0xfff00400



IO operations that are done explicitly by the user are not traced.

This command's output can be redirected to a file.
