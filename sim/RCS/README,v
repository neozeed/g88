This directory contains simulator source and documentation files.

paper.txt  - Ventura Publisher source of the USENIX paper on the simulator
             This does not have the diagrams, so is of limited use.
             See the real thing in the Winter 1990 USENIX Technical
             Conference Proceedings.

changes*   - Email I sent to simulator users.  Contains explanations
             of special simulator commands.  Most of this still applies
             to the gdb-front-ended simulator that you find here.

The result of running the Makefile is an object file, sim.o.  This
is then linked with the rest of gdb by gdb's Makefile.

Some symbolic links are made to source files in ..

If you don't need the I/O simulators, remove the reference to them
in io.c and delete their .o file from the list in Makefile.  Note
that you can not remove the CMMU simulator.
