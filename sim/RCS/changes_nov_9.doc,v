Subject: New versions of ad78 and d78 installed on cupcake. Also m78kreorder...


The cmmu simulator now simulates the data cache.  Unlike the real chip,
the simulated cmmu's cache only has what was written to it explicitly.
This should be good enough for the diagnostics that will test the cache
before turning it on.  I believe that the real cmmu's cache also has
only whatever was written to it explicitly before it is turned on.  If
the real cmmu's cache is turned on and doesn't work, well, the program
won't go very far before crashing.  So all the testing of the real
cmmu's cache ought to be done before the cache is turned on.

There is now a note describing the front-end's interface to the
simulator in //cupcake/usr/robertb/s78/sim_interface.doc.

The IO section has been modified to allow the user interface to
override the read-onlyness or write-onlyness of device registers.  This
allows for setting breakpoints in ROM's.  It also allows the BATC ports
to be write-only to the program but read-write to the user interface.

The cmmu section now no longer wastes 4 KB of memory for each cmmu.  It
is also cleaner inside so I have more confidence that it is correct.
The cmmu section is barely tested however.

On another tool ...

One of the recent changes that I made to the compiler to improve dbx
debugging information consisted of having the compiler add text
pseudo-ops in certain places.  This causes a bug that is in the
assembly code optimizer to appear.  The bug is that if the optimizer
sees a text directive without a matching data directive at the end of
the input file it generates incorrect code.   Motorola will fix it, but
probably not in the next release.  The symptoms are assembler error
messages complaining about multiple label definitions.  So I suggest
not using the -O flag with the 78000 compiler until the optimizer is
fixed.
