Subject: new d78 on cupcake
-------

I have changed:

 //cupcake/UTek/tools/bin/d78
 //cupcake/UTek/tools/lib78/{crt0.o,libc.a}
 //cupcake/usr/man/man1/d78.1

d78 now sports a "catch" and "ignore" command.  These set
and unset breakpoints on exceptions.  So if you want to
stop if you get an integer divide exception, type:

  catch IDE

When you continue, with the "cont" or "step" or "next" commands,
the exception will happen.  You can't tell d78 to ignore the
exception.

When single stepping by instructions there is more information
displayed now.  d78 will tell you what register was changed by
the last instruction and what its new value is.  If it was a
load or store, it will tell you the effective address used.
