Subject: Finally, at long last, d88 runs the kernel again, other fixes.
-------

Its in //cupcake/UTek/tools/bin/d88.

changes:

  1. It now has an IOB interrupt simulator that works.

  2. The ext, ff0, and ff1 instructions had bugs, are now
     fixed.  The ext instruction would not sign-extend if the
     width field was zero (arithmetic right shift).  The ff0 and
     ff1 instructions did not return the correct result if the
     source register had the value one.  Thanks to Norman Adams 
     for reporting these.

  3. The io command now displays more information.  The main addition
     is that the number of the transaction for the device is displayed.

  4. There is a new signal handling facility that should be used by
     device simulators instead of UTek's 'signal'.  It has the nice
     property that it will not call a handler during the execution
     of an 88000 instruction.  It calls handlers *between* instruction
     execution.  This eliminates most race conditions.  The timer chip
     and SCC simulators use the new facility.

  5. A bug that had caused d88 to say "pushvalue: case error" is fixed.

I do not have any kernel sources checked out and all d88 sources 
are checked in.
