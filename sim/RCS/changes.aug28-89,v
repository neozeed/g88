Subject: New d88, many changes
-------

It is installed on cupcake.  The man page on cupcake is up to date.
The help command lists every command in d88.

Bugs fixed:

1. Call now works more than once with print_scb_log().

2. Parameters are now correct, you no longer need to disassemble the
   first few instructions of a function to find where your parameter
   was stored.

3. Can now interrupt d88 while it is tracing.  Interrupting d88 in
   general is much improved.

4. No longer core dumps after an unsuccessful initial attempt to reset
   the target.

5. Now handles DACCs that occur as the result of debugger commands
   gracefully.

New features:

1. flush command: flushes d88's cache of target memory and tty line buffer.

2. bzero command, just like the kernel function, zero's target memory

3. bcopy command, just like the kernel function, copies target memory.

4. search command, searches target memory for a pattern.

5. probe and uprobe commands, like the aliases that many people used
   but gives more information.  The aliases stopped working when d88
   was changed to deal with write-protected kernel text, so please
   delete your probe and uprobe aliases.

   I removed the tran command as the probe and uprobe commands do
   about the same thing.

6. Take less VM.  When loading the kernel without net debugging symbols,
   it used to consume 14 MB, now it takes 10.4 MB.  This makes it
   faster on memory-starved systems.

7. Now single steps the machine after continue or run or when single
   stepping by source lines if there is a breakpoint at the current pc.
   This makes d88 faster and makes it easier to look at logic analyizer
   traces.

8. If $noparityinit is set, things will run faster.  The only time you
   can't have this set is between the time you turn the system on
   and the first download.

9. Now opens the remote tty line for exclusive use, so if someone else
   tries to use the same line they won't be able to.

10.If you use the -z flag and d88 is unable to interrupt the target it
   is a fatal error, d88 will no longer try to reset the target.

11.The help command now describes almost every command and only describes
   commands appropriate to the mode (remote or simulator).

You need new ROMs to use the bcopy and search commands.

If you know of any bugs besides the two listed at the end of the d88
man page, please let me know.  They are:

1. Recursive function invocation can confuse the where and
    return commands.

2. Assignment to bitfields doesn't work.

Thursday is my last day.
