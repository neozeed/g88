Subject: New man page for d78, new d78 and ad78 in //cupcake/Utek/tools/bin


The changes are:

  1. stopi now works if you use the "stopi at" form.  The generic dbx's
     stopi and tracei commands are nonfunctional (i.e., totally hosed)
     as far as I can tell.

  2. The man page (on cupcake) for d78 now describes the tracei and stopi
     commands and their limitations better.

  3. The device simulator initialization messages are no longer displayed.
     The ROM's initialization message can be seen with the pio command.

  4. There is a new command, "remote", that puts d78 into remote mode.  It
     opens the tty named by the environment variable "REMOTETTY" and
     expects a 78000 system on the other end.  This is not finished.

  5. There are several new debug flags, you can get a list by typing
     "debug".

  6. Floating point instructions will now generate a precise FP exception
     if in executing the instruction the simulator got a SIGFPE.  This
     isn't perfect, but its a lot better than what it used to do (I
     won't say what it used to do).

  7. The int, flt, and trnc instructions now work.  They used to always
     return zero.
