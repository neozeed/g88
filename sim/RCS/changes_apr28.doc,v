I checked in a number of changes to the 88000 simulator today.

They are:

  1. fixed a bug that caused the dmt0 and dmt1 registers to
     have incorrect values in some cases.

  2. added a cache in l_to_d to cache decoded instruction pointers.
     this sped up the simulator by about 10%

  3. changed the caching of logical 88k addresses.  Instead of having
     a one level tlb scheme now have a two level scheme.  The old 1 level
     scheme only cache logical addresses in the bottom and top
     of the address space.  The new scheme covers the whole space.

  4. added two more disk simulators to disk.c.

  5. made the size of the IO transaction history buffer be settable,
     by the environment variable SIMTRACE, instead of being fixed at
     10,000.

  6. added a count field to the io device structure.  It is displayed
     by the io command and is incremented every time an operation
     is done with the device.

  7. made numerous small corrections, cleanups, and stylistic 
     improvements.
