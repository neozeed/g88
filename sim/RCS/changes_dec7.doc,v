Some of the recent changes to d78 were unpopular and have been
undone.

	"A <RET> on a blank line repeats the last command."

Now, if you have $repeat_step defined, and the last command was a
step, stepi, next, or nexti, a <RET> will repeat it.

	"Numbers inside of character constants are interpreted as hex
	instead of octal.  So '\41' == 'A'."

They are interpreted as octal again.


Some more changes:

  1. There are 4 new operators for doing bit-wise logical operations.
     They are &, |, ^, and ~.  I needed & in order to write the rb 
     and rh macros for reading unsigned bytes and halfwords.

  2. The file //cupcake/usr/robertb/.d78init is changed, you may want
     to look at it if you want to use the memory peek/poke macros.

  3. Another bug having to do with assignment commands that have
     "*( addr \ & type)" as their lhs is fixed.  

  4. The RCS directory for d78 is now in //cupcake/UTek/src/dbx/d78.
     People rebuilding d78 should use this instead of the d78
     in my account.

  5. d78 used to give a message "subscript out of range" and
     abort the command if you did something like 
     "print buff[20]" where buff only has 10 elements.  It still 
     gives the message, but as a warning, it does the out-of-range
     operation.
