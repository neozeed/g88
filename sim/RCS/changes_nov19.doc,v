Subject: I checked in a bunch of s78 files, also d78 is under rcs now.

Fellow simulator coders,

   I checked in a number of files that implement a change to the basic
simulator code.  So next time you make, you might see a lot recompile.
If you get many undefines when you link with the front end it means
that you are using the latest, i.e. broken, GH compiler.  This compiler
does not support asm inserts.  So if that happens go back to the old
compiler at least to compiler execute.c.  You can find the old compiler
in //cupcake/lib/GHcomp.old

  The SCC simulator is at least partly working.  It looks for two
environment variables, SIMTTYA and SIMTTYB.  These are the file names of
the tty lines to use for the A and B ports of the SCC.  If either
variable is not defined the SCC simulator will use your terminal for the
one that's not defined.  If neither variable is defined both ports
will use your terminal.

  When the SCC simulator uses a tty line, it sets it up to run at 34 KB
in raw (8 bit) mode with hardware handshaking enabled.  As a test I had
one terminal with SIMTTYB set to "/dev/ttya0" and the with SIMTTYB set
to "/dev/ttya1".  These two ports on cupcake are connected to each
other.  I wrote to one the data port of SCC B while reading from the
same port on the other simulator.  And the data showed up!

  d78 is now under RCS.  You should do 

	"ln -s //cupcake/usr/robertb/d78/RCS" 

in a clean d78 directory.  It still makes symbolic links to files in
"../ad78".  The first time you run the makefile you will have to
explicitly check out all of the .c files.  I couldn't figure out the
problem with the makefile that prevents it from checking them out
itself.  The new Makefile knows about a lot more of the dependencies,
include the one on ../s78/sim.o.

	Rob
